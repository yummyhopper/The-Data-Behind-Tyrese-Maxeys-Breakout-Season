This presentation starts by focusing on Tyrese Maxey's improvement throughout his NBA career and asking how and why this happened. We start with a general impression of his basic statitics throughout his four year career, analyzing which overarching metrics are indicating this improvement. Then we go deeper on his shooting, where he's scoring from, with what shots, and in which scenarios. We analyze suggest pace of play and transition plays as a factor for why this improvement may be happening and give relevant data there. Finally, we end with how his move to point guard this year has changed the team dynamic specifically in the pick and roll game with Embiid. We conclude that each of these factors played a part in his improvement and give nuanced opinions connecting them together.
