    "Tyrese Maxey was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the 21st pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Coming out of college critics questioned his poor three point shooting in college and his injury prone past. However just four years into his NBA career he is an all star candidate on a top championship contender and one of the best young prospects in the league. Maxey's game has seen progression every year of his career but this season in particular he has broken out into the top flight of NBA point guards. The departure of former MVP point guard James Harden from the Sixers has opened the gap for Maxey to be the Sixer's clear number two offensive option behind current MVP Joel Embiid, and he has taken advantage. In this project we will analyze Tyrese Maxey's growth in offensive metrics throughout his career with particular focus on his improvement in productivity and efficiency, shooting, dribbling and passing, pace of play, and team impact. We will use numbers, graphics, and narrative angles to the story of his rise to stardom and explain what's going on under the hood.\n",

    "Box Plus/Minus, Version 2.0 (BPM) is a **basketball box score-based metric** that estimates a basketball player's contribution to the team when that player is on the court. It is based only on the information in the traditional basketball box score--no play-by-play data or non-traditional box score data (like dunks or deflections) are included.\n",

    "\n",
    "League average is defined as 0.0, meaning 0 points above average or below average. Because above-average players play more minutes, there are far more below-average players than above-average players in the league at any time. A value of +5.0 means the team is 5 points per 100 possessions better with the player on the floor than with average production from another player.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/bpmseason.png\" width= \"200\" height= \"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chart above, we have OBPM (Offensive BPM) and DBPM (Defensive BPM). Maxey's game impact has soared this season, jumping from **0.6** last year to an impressive **5.2**. To put it in perspective, his BPM ranks **14th in the entire league**. Now, let's break down what these numbers mean:\n",

    "* +10.0 is an all-time season (think peak Jordan or LeBron)\n",
    "* +8.0 is an MVP season (think peak Dirk or peak Shaq)\n",

    "* +0.0 is a decent starter or solid 6th man\n",
    "* -2.0 is a bench player (this is also defined as \"replacement level\")\n",
    "* Below -2.0 are many end-of-bench players\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxey's offensive BPM is an impressive **6.0**, placing him among **the top 8 OBPM players in the NBA**. On the flip side, his defense, with a DBPM of only **-0.8**, doesn't contribute positively to the team. Given Maxey's shorter height and less physical build, his defense isn't expected to be a strong suit. However, his dazzling offensive performance often overshadows any defensive shortcomings. It's worth noting that Maxey is even improving his defense, moving from **-1.2 last year** to **-0.8 this season**.\n",

    "The biggest knock on Tyrese Maxey coming out of college was his poor three point shooting coming out of college. In today's NBA a 29.2% three point percentage is unacceptable from a starting point guard no matter his other attributes. Nevertheless, the Sixers took a gamble on the young Kentucky guard, and four years in this is how his shooting has progressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/basic_shooting.png\" width = \"800\" height = \"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth in his three point shooting was dramatic from his Rookie to Sophmore campaign in the NBA. Going from one of the worst three point shooting guards in the league to living in the elite 40%+ range ever since. This year he has actually regressed a bit in three point shooting percentage, likely due to the teams higher reliance on his skills which causes him to take more contested and difficult shots. Another takeaway is that while his two point percentage has been relatively stable throughout his career this year it has skyrocketed to over 90%. This could help explain his improvement this year, since the increased efficiency from the line corresponds to opponents focusing more on stopping him and drawing more fouls. However, Maxey's progression has been more nuanced than these cumulative numbers. Maxey's shot selection data tells a different story about which types of shots he is most efficient at, and how these numbers have changed across his career.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/shot_types.png\" width = \"800\" height = \"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "From the shot selection data we can see that Maxey's running layup is his best shot this year, converting at a stunning efficiency. This could be due to his scoring in transition and his dribble handoff plays he's ran with Embiid this season. His jump shot efficiency has also steadily improved since entering the league, whereas his driving layup and pull up jumper have regressed a bit this year. This data tells us what sort of shots Tyrese Maxey is improving, but it doesn't tell us much about where he's improving from. His shot charts throughout his career can help us explore where these shots were coming from and  where on the floor this improvement was happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/shot_charts.png\" width = \"800\" height = \"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing Maxey's rookie season to his fourth year in the league (with a similar number of games) the added wrinkles to his game are obvious. The threes are coming from the middle left and middle right of the arc and his finishing inside the key is coming from more different spot rather than right under the rim. Notably absent throughout the charts are areas of scoring in the midrange. His low efficiency shooting off the dribble with his pull up jumper and his lack of a post up game are likely contributors. However, the overall diversity of scoring options are making him more difficult to guard and unpredictable with the ball in his hands. In years two and three the corner threes and range of areas in the paint are more pronounced, and this year you can see the beginnings of those same patterns emerging again. \n",

    "**Assist percentage** is an estimate of the percentage of teammate field goals a player assisted while he was on the floor. The formula is 100 * AST / (((MP / (Tm MP / 5)) * Tm FG) - FG). **Turnover percentage** is an estimate of turnovers per 100 plays. The formula is 100 * TOV / (FGA + 0.44 * FTA + TOV). In short, these two variables can reflect one's assist level and turnover rate in a scientific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the chart, despite Maxey's increased playmaking role, he manages to control turnovers exceptionally well, surpassing the league average. This suggests that not only is Maxey creating opportunities for teammates, but he's doing so with remarkable efficiency and precision.\n",

He has not only boosted his assist percentage and usage percentage significantly but has also slashed the turnover percentage. This kind of progress is not just commendable; it's exceptional. Maxey's potential in dribbling and passing is on a trajectory that's hard to measure, and he's already proven himself as a reliable source of attack.\n",

With such a young talented player running so much and so fast throughout a game, the coaching and team around him will pick up their speed to complement him.

    "Since the departure of former MVP James Harden, the 76ers have found a new pairing powerhouse in the form of Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. Maxey, transitioning from a shooting guard to a **point guard role** this season, has seamlessly joined forces with the 7-foot-tall, sharp-shooting center, forming a classic and deadly duo that strikes fear into their opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img1/Embiid_Maxey.jpg\" width = \"500\" height = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxey and Embiid stand out as the linchpins of the 76ers' most frequently used 5-man lineups, playing the most minutes and games together. This duo, known as the **Embiid-Maxey pair**, has a generally positive impact on the team. In their most frequent lineup, they secure an average lead of **7.7 points** during their **13.8-minute** play per game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the coach seems to prefer having Maxey and Embiid on the court together, as evidenced by their high usage rate in 5-man lineups. When playing without Embiid, the team's performance is less impressive. The most frequent lineup where **Maxey plays without Embiid** **lost 7.3 points in average during their 5.8-minute play per game**. It indicates the coach's strategic choice to deploy them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of 2-man lineup, surprisingly, Embiid and Maxey is only the **5th most-time pair** in 76ers. Despite not being the most frequent pairing, Embiid and Maxey boast the **highest offensive rating, net rating, and player impact estimate** among the top five most-used pairs. This dynamic duo consistently delivers stability and efficiency, making them a reliable force on the court.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Batum emerges as a valuable offensive role player for the 76ers, the Embiid-Maxey duo remains the most dependable even in his absence. Batum's exceptional shooting percentages highlight his contribution, but the sample size is small, making it premature to crown him as the team's best offensive player. As a 3D player (3-point and defense), Batum has a wonderful performance recently, way above his average, which means he perhaps cannot keep this efficiency through the whole season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Embiid-Maxey partnership is not just a statistical success; it's a game-changer for the 76ers. Despite their ranking as the **66th most-used pair** in the league, their **offensive rating** and **player impact estimated** are undeniably advanced.\n",

    "Similar to the previous formidable duo of James Harden and Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid engage in a variety of plays, particularly utilizing pick-and-roll actions in their two-man game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxey significantly dominates the ballhandling plays for the 76ers, accounting for more than half of the total possessions at **8.8 times** per game out of a **team total of 16.6**. While Maxey has a high **frequency of ballhandler plays at 37.3%**, his efficiency is slightly lower at **0.93 points per possession** compareda to the team's overall efficiency of **0.95 points per possession**. On the other hand, Embiid excels as the roll man in the pick-and-roll (P&R) play, contributing to **5.4 of the team's 7.9 roll man plays** per game and scoring efficiently with **1.08 points per play**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The offensive focus of the team remains predominantly on Embiid, and on-court scenarios often unfold as illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img1/screenassist.png\" width = \"600\" height = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Embiid (Number 21) sets a screen for Maxey (the ballhandler in the picture), who then uses his dribbling skills to dismantle the defense. Instead of cutting to the basket, Embiid moves back to the 3-point line. Maxey returns the ball to Embiid, capitalizing on the space created by Maxey's penetration. Embiid, with his exceptional shooting abilities, takes advantage of the open space to contribute to the team's offensive prowess.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img1/screenassist3.png\" width = \"600\" height = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the dual offensive threats posed by Embiid and Maxey, opposing defenses struggle to allocate suitable defenders. Embiid's height and shooting prowess, coupled with Maxey's 3-point shooting and speed, make it challenging for opponents to defend effectively. This dynamic creates ample space for both players and their teammates, opening opportunities for set-up 3-point shots and cuts. It's essential to note that, in these scenarios, Embiid remains the primary scoring focal point, while Maxey takes on a more facilitating role as a passer and playmaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Joel Embiid finds limited scoring opportunities, he becomes a key playmaker for his teammates, particularly benefiting Tyrese Maxey. Nearly **half of the team's screen assists (totaling 8.0 assists)** come from Embiid, resulting in **3.7 assists** per game, translating to **8.9 points**. The majority of these screen plays involve 2-point shots (**10.6 attempts per game**), with some also featuring 3-point attempts (**3.0 per game**).\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img1/screen2.png\" width = \"600\" height = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In these scenarios, Maxey cleverly utilizes Embiid's imposing presence as cover. Leveraging his exceptional speed and dribbling skills, Maxey executes classic floaters with ease. The threat of Maxey's passing ability adds an extra layer of complexity for defenders, forcing them to account for potential assists as they defend against his scoring attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img1/screen3.png\" width = \"600\" height = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Handoff plays provide another avenue for creating opportunities for Embiid's teammates, with Maxey leading in this category. Maxey is involved in nearly **half of the team's total handoff plays**, **surpassing the team average frequency by 2.3 times (Maxey's frequency is 13.4%)**. He demonstrates remarkable efficiency in this play type, generating **1.3 points per play**. Out of the team's **6.8 possessions** involving handoffs, Maxey takes up **3.2** of them.\n",

Maxey capitalizes on the opportunities provided by Embiid, showcasing a well-rounded offensive skill set that includes mid-range shots, floaters, and efficient scoring from various positions on the court.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Maxey's exceptional speed and versatile attacking skills, as highlighted in previous sections, make him both a lethal scoring weapon and an excellent playmaker for his partner, Embiid. While Embiid remains the primary scoring option, Maxey takes advantage of the defensive attention drawn by Embiid to contribute significantly. Their pick-and-roll plays are a regular and effective weapon, with both players benefiting mutually from each other's skills.\n",
