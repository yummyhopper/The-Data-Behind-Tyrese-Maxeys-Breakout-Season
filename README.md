### Introduction

Tyrese Maxey was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the 21st pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Coming out of college critics questioned his poor three point shooting in college and his injury prone past. However just four years into his NBA career he is an all star candidate on a top championship contender and one of the best young prospects in the league. Maxey's game has seen progression every year of his career but this season in particular he has broken out into the top flight of NBA point guards. The departure of former MVP point guard James Harden from the Sixers has opened the gap for Maxey to be the Sixer's clear number two offensive option behind current MVP Joel Embiid, and he has taken advantage. In this project we will analyze Tyrese Maxey's growth in offensive metrics throughout his career with particular focus on his improvement in productivity and efficiency, shooting, dribbling and passing, pace of play, and team impact. We will use numbers, graphics, and narrative angles to the story of his rise to stardom and explain what's going on under the hood.
